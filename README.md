# Student-Performance-Analysis
This project explores how various demographic factors affect student exam scores. The analysis was done using Python (Pandas for EDA) and Power BI for visualization.

Dataset Source: Kaggle â€“ Students Performance in Exams
Columns include gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

Main Objectives:

Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis

Answer key questions such as:

Does parental education affect math scores?

Is there a gender gap in performance?

Does test preparation improve results?

What traits do top 5% performers share?

Categorize students into performance clusters

Visualize findings through a clean Power BI dashboard

Deliverables:

Python notebook with cleaned, structured EDA code

Cleaned CSV for dashboard import

Power BI dashboard with slicers, bar charts, KPI cards, and scatter plots

The final dashboard is designed to be interactive, visually clear, and easy to interpret for educators and decision-makers.
